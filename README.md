# CompB_E.Coli

Previously, researchers have revisted sequencing of the E.coli K12 strain as it has evolved over time since when the whole genome was first sequenced.The purpose of this project is to resequence the E.coli K12 genome to see how it has evolved over time. 

The following python3 code is a step by step guide to retrieving the required sequence, assembling the genome, annotating the assembly,
