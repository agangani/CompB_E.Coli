# CompB_E.Coli

Previously, researchers have revisted sequencing of the E.coli K12 strain as it has evolved over time since when the whole genome was first sequenced. The purpose of this project is to resequence the E.coli K12 genome to see how it has evolved over time.

In general, the following python3 code is a step by step guide to retrieving the required sequence, assembling the genome, annotating the assembly, analyzing the discprencies from the assembled genome in RefSeq for E.coli K-12 (NC_000913), building an index, aligning the genome sequence to the reference sequnce, and finally assembling the reads. 

Here are the following tools you will need to have installed in order to successfully run the code on python3:
-wget 
-SPAdes
-prokka
-tophat2
-cufflinks
-SRA-tool kit
